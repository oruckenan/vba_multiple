I worked for many years in companies doing the full database for all the departments of the company.  I used at this time microsoft access and VBA for it, for handling many hundred thousands lines of record.  
More important than database creation was handing the data and cooperation and communication with the department supervisor and workers to make the data consistent and reliable. 
Then the following was taking me great time: teaching data operators and handover the database to them . 
I applied successfully my knowledge and being succesfull in  6 project: each project was abot 2 years. So during about 12 years I had experience in it.

On my experience, a database developper is forced to work in team so as the database creation and maagement getting successfull. 
If I can handover a database and being sure all works well without constant supervising than all is well.
About 7 years ago, I started doing this in PHP and MySQL. 
All these database were either offline desktop application or intranet based applications. This was a choice of mine and my managers. Because we did not wanted to raise up the expense by placing the databse on online platform and take a risk of being hacked. This is also what I suggest you, 
I am willing to work in long term with your company. Freelancing is my main job, so it is a serious regular job in my mind.
I have great experience in freelancing since 2004 using the first and best freelancing sites at this time (it was named rentacoder). 
I can provide you many more details up on your request.
