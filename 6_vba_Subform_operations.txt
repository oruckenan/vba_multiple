'> question:
'> 
'> Can all the values on a subform be reset at once.
'> Example:
'> Have a form with subforms,subforms get made visible or not visible
'> depending on choice of a field(incident) on mainform.
'> If the user makes a incident choice, starts entering data on the 
'> subform made visible, then decides they are wrong, clicks to 
'change 
'> incident choice, gets another subform, the data from the first 
'choice 
'> is written to the record.
'> I would like to reset all the values on that subform when it goes 
'from 
'> visible to not-visible.
